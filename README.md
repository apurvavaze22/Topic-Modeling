# Topic-Modeling
Topic modeling on the text within the "About" section of LinkedIn profiles.

Introduction:
In the fast-paced world of professional networking, where first impressions matter, our LinkedIn profile is our digital business card. Among its various sections, the "About" information is a crucial space where we can showcase our professional identity and leave a lasting impression on potential connections. One powerful technique to enhance the effectiveness of our LinkedIn "About" section is topic modeling, a method in natural language processing that uncovers hidden thematic structures within a text. By employing algorithms to analyze content and identify recurring themes or topics, topic modeling not only organizes information but also boosts the discoverability of key skills, experiences, and interests.

This repository contains python script for topic modeling along with the source data file used which contains the LinkedIn users "About" information. 
Script is well-documented, utilizing popular text mining LDA model for extracting topics from corpus and coherence score model to get optimum number of topics. Feel free to explore the code, adapt it to your needs, and contribute to its improvement. For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the documentation within each script.
