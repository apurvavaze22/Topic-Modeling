I built my first electrical circuit at the age of 12, programmed my first C++ application by 14 and decided to pursue Electrical Engineering as a career. Upon graduation, I found myself at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing site where I tackled technical challenges that pushed me to learn, develop myself as a leader and execute multimillion-dollar projects while leading cross-functional teams. This role was fundamental to my career and allowed me to develop key relationships in the industry. Some of the most exciting projects I completed during this time include two-line roll-outs (valued over $20MM each) and a Research & Development project that allowed the production of PocketPearl (Highly successful P&G brand).

I transitioned into Salesforce Ecosystem from a non-tech background and achieved my first Certification 51 days after first discovering Salesforce.  

In less than 2 years, I was able to become a Lead Solution Engineer at Salesforce UK & Ireland before embarking on my own adventure to help open up the Salesforce Ecosystem to others through my training platform - Get Force Certified. I was able to study and pass a further 6 Certifications in 9 months, including CPQ and Field Service using the same methods and techniques that I teach.

My goal is to provide the best Salesforce Training to help people turbo charge their Salesforce studies and learn in a more effective and efficient way. I pride my teachings on being clear, concise, and comprehensive, allowing you to become Salesforce Certified quicker and easier.

He is the Founder of DLT Labs, which is a global leader in developing blockchain solutions using distributed ledger technology.As an expert in financial cryptography at the Royal Bank of Canada, Neeraj led a team to be one of the first in the market to launch Apple Pay. During this time, in 2011, he came across the Bitcoin code base and intrigued, he delve deep into the blockchain code. He immediately recognized that blockchain could be applied far beyond cryptocurrency and its potential to revolutionize financial cryptography. Neeraj has spent the last decade bringing awareness of this to the world, starting with the financial and supply chain industries.His first large-scale success with implementing enterprise blockchain technology was with Walmart Canada where Neeraj led DLT Labs to solve Walmart's supply chain challenges. This resulted in Walmart Canada increasing its operational efficiency by reducing  manual reconciliation of third-party carrier invoices from 70% to under 2%. This success demonstrated what Neeraj had been predicting all along - that blockchain is capable of helping businesses generate significant operational and financial gains.Neeraj understands the technology side as well as the business side of running a successful venture. Since his engineering days in college, he has been an advocate for real world applications of classroom learning and thus founded his college's first Software Incubator - an innovation hub so successful that it has become a model for other technology incubators. He has since added a Blockchain Lab to the hub and provides education and employment opportunities. He is passionate about mentoring students and young technologists in learning blockchain while also helping them develop an entrepreneurial mindset. Neeraj was the first to launch a developer level course on Blockchain and continues to travel the world educating and speaking on the topics of Blockchain and real-world applications of how it can revolutionize every industry.
